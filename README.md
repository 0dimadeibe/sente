# Sente

## Realtime web comms for Clojure/Script

**Sente** is a small client+server library that makes it easy to build **realtime web applications** with Clojure + ClojureScript.

Loosely inspired by [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), it uses **core.async**, **WebSockets**, and **Ajax** under the hood to provide a simple high-level API that enables **reliable, high-performance, bidirectional communications**.

> **Sen-te** (ÂÖàÊâã) is a Japanese [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) term used to describe a play with such an overwhelming follow-up that it demands an immediate response, leaving its player with the initiative.

## Latest release

- 2023-07-04: `1.18.1` - [release notes](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente/releases/tag/v1.18.1) | [Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.taoensso/sente/versions/1.18.1)

## Resources
1. [Wiki][wiki] - **community docs** (üëà start here)
1. [Release info][] - releases and changes
1. [API docs][] - auto-generated API docs
1. [GitHub issues][] - for support requests, contributions, etc.

## Features

* **Bidirectional a/sync comms** over **WebSockets** with **auto Ajax fallback**
* **It just works**: auto keep-alives, buffering, protocol selection, reconnects
* Efficient design with transparent event batching for **low-bandwidth use, even over Ajax**
* Send **arbitrary Clojure vals** over [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn
) or [Transit](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-clj) (JSON, MessagePack, etc.)
* **Tiny API** (see the [wiki][] for details)
* Automatic, sensible support for users connected with **multiple clients** and/or devices simultaneously
* Realtime info on **which users are connected** over which protocols
* Standard **Ring security model**: auth as you like, HTTPS when available, CSRF support, etc.
* Support for [several popular web servers](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente/tree/master/src/taoensso/sente/server_adapters), [easily extended](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente/blob/master/src/taoensso/sente/interfaces.cljc) to other servers.
